## Hello

I'm Tobi. Turiiya is a Sanskrit name I got when spending a good part of my life in an ashram.

## About - Side Facts

I completed my education in multimedia design and IT in 2008.

In 2004, at the age of 13, I published my first websites. Around the same time, I started creating mods and user interfaces for games, which led me on a journey of UI and UX development.

Today, I program open-heartedly in nearly every language. I worked on 250+ projects.\
When I don't work WITH the tools, I usally work ON the tools. Be it the editors, extensions, the libraries or the programming language ifself.

Next to being a nerd I'm also a licensed fitness trainer and nutritionist and have volunteered for various organizations for several years.

### Personal focus tasks

- 📚 Keep learning _(though, it is a vicious circle, as the more you know, the more you realize that you don't know)_
- 💤 Add sleep
- 💆 Keep my shit together, make some babies, and be a responsible parent (most of the time).
- 🎸 Restring guitar
- 🧘 Visit friends in ashram
- 🏋️ Update health

## Toolbox

It doesn't take much to make work faster, more enjoyable and fun. Some honorable mentions that help the optimize processes and productivity with the technologies I use in day-to-day work are:

- 🪟 For me, a keyboard-driven tiling window manager is a game-changer for workflows ([bismuth](https://github.com/Bismuth-Forge/bismuth), [polonium](https://github.com/zeroxoneafour/polonium), [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM) are awesome in combination with a regular desktop environment).
- <sup><sub>⌨️ ⌨️</sub></sup> A programmable split keyboard - provides ergonomics, ~~em~~VIMpowers navigation of my whole OS (current: keebio iris, bobagum silent switches, blank low-profile keycaps).
- 🧠 Knowledge management tools - atm it's neovim to manage an obsidian vault. However, it's hard to settle when exceptional software like <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan">siyuan-note</a> is emerging.
- 🔫 The secret sauce is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tenxsoydev/nxvim/">nxvim</a>.
