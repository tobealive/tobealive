> Turiiya is a Sanskrit name I got when spending a good part of my life in an ashram.
> My social - let's say Muggle-name - is Tobi.

> ## About - Side Facts
>
> - Completed education in multimedia design and IT in 2008.
> - Back in 2004, at the age of 13, my first websites were published.
> - Around the same time, creating mods and user interfaces for games started a journey of UI and UX development.
> - Today, I program open-heartedly in nearly every language.
> - The tally of projects worked on exceeds 250.
> - When not working WITH the tools, I usually work ON the tools. Be it the libraries and frameworks, the editors and extensions, or the programming language itself.

> Next to being a nerd I'm also a licensed fitness trainer and nutritionist and have volunteered for various organizations for several years. I also like spending time with friends - be it humans or other animals.

> ## Toolbox
>
> It doesn't take much to make work faster, more enjoyable and fun. Some honorable mentions that help the optimize processes and productivity with the technologies I use in day-to-day work are:
>
> - For me, a keyboard-driven tiling window manager is a game-changer for workflows ([bismuth](https://github.com/Bismuth-Forge/bismuth) / [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM) are awesome in combination with a regular desktop environment).
> - A programmable split keyboard - provides ergonomics, ~~em~~VIMpowers navigation of my whole OS.
> - Knowledge management tools - atm it's neovim to manage an obsidian vault. However, it's hard to settle when exceptional software like <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan">siyuan-note</a> is emerging.
> - The secret sauce is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tenxsoydev/nxvim/">nxvim</a>.
