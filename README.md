**Hello there 🙏**

I go by Turiiya. That's a Sanskrit name I got when I spent a good part of my life in the ashram.
My societal - let's say "muggle-name" - is Tobi.

I completed my education in IT with a focus on multimedia technologies in 2008. I'm also a licensed fitness trainer and nutritionist and have volunteered for various organizations for several years.

- 👣 Published my first websites in 2004 at the age of 13 (which wouldn't be that early today I guess).
- 🏆 Had several awarded and top ranking website designs in the following years.
- 🕳️ Creating some user interfaces and mods for games 15+ years ago started me on a journey of UI and UX development.
- 🌐 Today, I program open-heartedly in nearly every language. Except Java. Life is too short to code in Java.
- 👷 Done quite some DevOps work, but haven't found the time to finish the advanced DevOps Pro exam yet.
- 🚀 Would love to do more web3 related work.

Personal focus tasks

- 📚 Keep learning _(though, it is a vicious circle, as the more you know, the more you realize that you don't know)_
- 💤 Add sleep
- 💆 Keep my shit together, make some babies, and be a responsible parent (most of the time).
- 🎸 Restring guitar
- 🧘 Visit friends in ashram
- 🏋️ Update health

Good tooling makes working faster, more pleasant and fun.

- 🪟 I see no way to achieve proper workflows without a tiling window manager ([bismuth](https://github.com/Bismuth-Forge/bismuth), [polonium](https://github.com/zeroxoneafour/polonium), [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM) are awesome in combination with a regular desktop environment).
- <sup><sub>⌨️ ⌨️</sub></sup> A programmable split keyboard - provides ergonomics, ~~em~~VIMpowers navigation of my whole OS (current: keebio iris, bobagum silent switches, blank low-profile keycaps).
- 🧠 Knowledge management tools - atm neovim to manage an obsidian vault. However, it's hard to settle when exceptional software like <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan">siyuan-note</a> is emerging.
- 🔫 The secret sauce is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tenxsoydev/nxvim/">nxvim</a>.
