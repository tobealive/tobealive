> ## About Me

> Turiiya is actually a Sanskrit name. Spending a good part of my life in an ashram is what brought it to me.
> My social - let's say Muggle-name - is Tobi.
>
> Next to being a computer nerd, I love to snowboard.
> I'm also a licensed fitness trainer and nutritionist, and have volunteered for various organizations for several years.

> **_Some side facts related to coding_**
>
> - Graduation in information technology with focus on multimedia design in 2008.
> - Frist web projects published in 2004, at the age of 13.
> - Around the same time, creating mods and user interfaces for games started a journey of UI and UX development.
> - Today, I program open-heartedly in nearly every language and do a lot of DevOps work.
> - The tally of projects worked on exceeds 250.

> **_Some personal focus tasks_**
>
> - Keep learning _(continuing on a vicious cycle - the more you know, the more you realize that you don't know)_.
> - Work hard, but less. Add sleep, update health, make some babies.
> - More guitar playing.
> - Visit friends in ashram.
