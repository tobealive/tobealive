> When I'm not working WITH the tools, I'm usually working ON the tools.
> Be it the libraries and frameworks, the editors and extensions or the programming language itself.

> I contribute to open source projects wherever possible, which has put this profile in the top 3% of over 100 million GH profiles.
> Many recent contributions relate to [vlang/v](http://github.com/vlang/v) and its ecosystem.
